Example: English to predicate logic
Suppose our domain is people and that we have the following two predicates:

K(x): whether person x is a kid
M(x): whether person x likes marshmallows
We will practice translating from English to predicate logic. Think about what the following sentences mean, and click to reveal each answer:

No kids like marshmallows.
¬(∃ x (K(x) ∧ M(x)), or equivalently, ∀ x (K(x) → ¬M(x))


Not all kids like marshmallows.
¬(∀ x (K(x) → M(x)), or equivalently, ∃ x (K(x) ∧ ¬M(x))


Everyone who likes marshmallows is a kid.
∀ x (M(x) → K(x))


Some people who like marshmallows are not kids.
∃ x (M(x) ∧ ¬K(x))


Some kids don’t like marshmallows.
∃ x (K(x) ∧ ¬M(x))


Anyone who doesn’t like marshmallows is not a kid.
∀ x (¬M(x) → ¬K(x))
