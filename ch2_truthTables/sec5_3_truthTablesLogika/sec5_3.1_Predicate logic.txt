Suppose we have some domain, and that P(x) is a predicate for individuals in that domain. DeMorgan’s laws give us the following equivalencies:

¬(∃ x P(x)) is equivalent to ∀ x ¬P(x)
¬(∀ x P(x)) is equivalent to ∃ x ¬P(x)

Example: English to predicate logic
Suppose our domain is people and that we have the following two predicates:

K(x): whether person x is a kid
M(x): whether person x likes marshmallows
We will practice translating from English to predicate logic. Think about what the following sentences mean, and click to reveal each answer:

No kids like marshmallows.
Click here for solution
¬(∃ x (K(x) ∧ M(x)), or equivalently, ∀ x (K(x) → ¬M(x))


Not all kids like marshmallows.
Click here for solution
¬(∀ x (K(x) → M(x)), or equivalently, ∃ x (K(x) ∧ ¬M(x))


Everyone who likes marshmallows is a kid.
Click here for solution
∀ x (M(x) → K(x))


Some people who like marshmallows are not kids.
Click here for solution
∃ x (M(x) ∧ ¬K(x))


Some kids don’t like marshmallows.
Click here for solution
∃ x (K(x) ∧ ¬M(x))


Anyone who doesn’t like marshmallows is not a kid.
Click here for solution
∀ x (¬M(x) → ¬K(x))
