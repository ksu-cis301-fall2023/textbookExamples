//Example 3: While loops
//This program canâ€™t be run the way it appears below, as Logika wants you to do some verification work first. However, this program demonstrates what a while loop will look like:

import org.sireum.logika._

var cur: Z = 10
while (cur >= 1) {
    println("Next number: ", cur)
    cur = cur - 1
}
