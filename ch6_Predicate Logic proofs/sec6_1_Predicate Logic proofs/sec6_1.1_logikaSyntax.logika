//Suppose we wish to prove the following sequent:

//∀ x P(x) ⊢ ∀ y P(y)

∀ x P(x) ⊢ ∀ y P(y)
{
    1. ∀ x P(x)         premise
    2 {
        3. x            //our fresh individual
        4. P(a)         AllE(1)
        //need: P(a)
    }
    //want to use ∀i to conclude ∀ y P(y)
    5. ∀ z P(y)         AllI(1)
}

//Note: Will say Logika verified for everything...need to use .sc files
