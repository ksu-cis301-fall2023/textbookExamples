For each chapter in https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/:

- If the current chapter contains at least one Logika proof/truth table (the first such chapter is Ch. 2):
    - create a folder for the chapter under "src" in this repo under. Name the folder with the chapter number
        and name (or abbreviation). For example: "ch2_truthTables".

- Identify which sections in that chapter contain Logika proofs/truth tables (they tend to be multiple lines
    in a black box). The earliest section with Logika proofs (in this case, a truth table) is 2.2.

- Create a subfolder for that section within the chapter folder. For example, "sec2_2_truthTablesLogika"
    should be a subfolder of "ch2_truthTables"



Then, for each Logika proof in the textbook:

- create a new file in the corresponding subfolder. It should have the extension ".logika", and should
    be named with a combination of the section number and the most recent header in the textbook. For example,
    the first proof https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis301/2-chapter/2_2-logikatruth/index.html should be:
        sec2_2_logikaSyntax.logika

- if the same proof/truth table in the textbook is developed in stages until it is finally completed,
    only create a .logika file for the completed version. You'll know it's the complete version because it
    will say "Logika verified".


(Later, I will include instructions on translating the examples to the new Logika format.)
